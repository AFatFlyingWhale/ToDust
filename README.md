# To Dust is a personal mod designed to help learn Java and Fabric, featuring a number of concepts taken straight from Systema, a WIP fanfic/fangame that has been in development for roughly 4 years.
## Established as a Vanilla+ concept that will add new materials, new crystalline geodes (Dust Crystals), new tools, armor, enchantments and charms, To Dust has a greater end-game focus beyond simply the Deep Dark.
